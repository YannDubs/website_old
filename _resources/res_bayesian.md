<summary>:mortar_board: Bayesian Deep Learning Workshop NIPS 2016</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : multiple.
+ Review : Good videos of the workshop. Being able to listen to many of the best researchers in this quickly growing field is very interesting. Unfortunate the videos are too short to really be able to cover the subject with great depth.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Stand alone videos for anyone interested in Bayesian Deep Learning (should have some knowledge of ML and DL).
+ Level : Intermediate-Advanced.
