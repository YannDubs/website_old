<summary>:books: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [C. Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Bishop){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : :heart: I just love it, excellent mix between maths and intuition
+ Recommend as : 
    * Introduction self-learning book if you have some mathematical background
    * If you have applied machine learning algorithms but now to get a better theoretical knowledge.
+ Notes : Probably the most famous ML book.

<summary>:books: Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective</summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [K. Murphy](https://research.google.com/pubs/KevinMurphy.html){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : Excellent reference book which covers a wide range of ML topics with a statistical perspective. Probably not a book to read at once or to use as an introduction to the field. Aimed to people with a decent mathematical background. Can sometimes feel a bit disorganized.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Reference book to use a refresher for those who already understand of the concepts.
    * To get a probabilistic view of some concepts you already know.
    * Instructors that want a book as a supplement to their class.
+ Notes : famous as a reference book.

<summary>:headphones: Machine Learning </summary>
<div markdown='1'>

+ Author : [A. Ng](andrewng.org){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : :heart: Perfectly mixes mathematical theory, intuition and practice through coding. Covers a very wide range of core machine learning concepts. Gives you the necessary basics to start learning about state of the art machine learning. Doesn't require any prerequisite knowledge, if you have some background you will often watch in 2x or skip parts. The only small thing I would have done differently is use python rather than octave.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Course if you don't have a heavy mathematical background but are serious about starting in machine learning.
    * Go-to resource to learn about machine learning.
+ Notes : by far the most famous resource to get into the field, one of the most watched coursera MOOC.

+ Author : [S. Charrington](https://twitter.com/samcharrington?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : I listen to it during all of my daily commutes or when I cook! I really enjoy it: it's an excellent way of getting an overview of what people are doing in the domain (research or industry) while being able to multi task as most of the episodes aren't to technical. I enjoy the fact that it covers a wide range of methods and domains. I rarely learn about new subjects, but it often gives some interesting perspectives.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Podcast for multi tasking : daily commute / cleaning / cooking.
    * Podcast for new machine learning enthusiast that do not want to go to much in the details
    * Podcast for people working in industry who want to have an idea of how machine learning could be applied to their domain

+ Author : [B. Lorica](http://radar.oreilly.com/ben){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : Before TWiML&AI, I was listening to this one. Very good podcast and speakers. It is mostly focused on scalable enterprise machine learning. I had to try an other podcast while I was waiting for the next episode, I never came back as the subjects covered weren't my favorite (lots of Apache tools). 
+ Recommend as : 
    * Podcast for people who want to use scalable machine learning in their work.

+ Author : [K. Polich](https://about.me/kylepolich){:.mdLink}.
+ Review : Very nice podcast to learn about general data science. I stopped listening to it as I had a good knowledge of the majority of the topics discussed. Nevertheless very good introductory podcast.
+ Recommend as : 
    * Podcast for people who are interested in learning more about data science.
