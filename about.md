Hey :v: 

I'm currently studying a [MPhil in Machine Learning](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/WebHome){:.mdLink} at [Cambridge University, UK](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:.mdLink}. As an undergrad, I studied were in biomedical engineering at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/){:.mdLink} and spent an exchange year at [UBC, Canada](https://www.ubc.ca/){:.mdLink}. Before coming to England, I had the chance to work :

* As a Data Scientist Trainee in [Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(company)){:.mdLink}'s User Trust Team. Grab is the leading ride-hailing startup in Asia-Pacific, which explains why you've never heard of it :sweat_smile: . I was working on building a general NLP pipeline and classifying user review. It was a lot of fun, but challenging as the text can be in Thai, Vietnamese, Bahasa, Burmese, ...  :mag: <span class="note"> Side Note: </span> Thai doesn't use whitespacestoseparatewords ! Not so simple for preprocessing :sweat_smile: .

* As a Research Assistant at the [ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands](https://www.illc.uva.nl/){:.mdLink}'s. There I was working under the supervision of [Dr. Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/){:.mdLink}, on enabling extrapolation in NLP through a new attention mechanism.
 
In my free-time I like to play many sports (basketball, volleyball, bouldering, rowing: you name it), watch machine learning MOOCs and trying to improve cool ideas (*e.g.* [Hash Embeddings](https://github.com/YannDubs/Hash-Embeddings){:.mdLink}). 

I find most of the ML domains fascinating, but I'm especially interested representation learning and applications to NLP. I want to spend my next few year investigating  **probabilistic grounded representations of concepts**: some kind of Word2Vec which is trained through embodied multi-modal data, and is encoded as probability distributions instead of point estimates on a high dimensional manifold.

PS: Check out my [resume](/resume.pdf){:.mdLink} for more information.

PSx2: This picture was taken a loooooong time ago, but I thought it was appropriate for this page :telephone_receiver: :blush:.
