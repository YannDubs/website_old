Hey :v: 

I recently graduated in biomedical engineering from [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/){:.mdLink}. I spent my last year as an exchange student at [UBC, Canada](https://www.ubc.ca/){:.mdLink} and decided to shift to machine learning there. During and after my studies I have worked on:

* A mutation ranking algorithm for mono-genic conditions. This made me switch to machine learning :heart_eyes:.

* Predicting room and building occupancies from wi-fi data to make HVAC control systems more efficient.

* I'm currently working as a Data Scientist Trainee in [Grab](https://www.epfl.ch/){:.mdLink}'s User Trust Team. Grab is the leading ride-hailing startup in Asia-Pacific, which explains why you've never heard of it. I'm working on NLP to understand users review. It's a lot of fun, but challenging as reviews can be in Thai, Malay, Indonesian, ... 

:mag: <span class="note"> Side Note: </span> Thai doesn't use whitespacestoseparatewords ! Not so simple for preprocessing :sweat_smile: .
 
In my **free-time** I love to run, play any sports (with a biais towards basketball), drink a beer or smoke a cigar with friends, watch MOOCs and learn about new Machine Learning stuff. 

I find most of the ML domains fascinating, but if I had to chose only a few, I would go with: **[Bayesian Optimisation](/machine-learning-glossary/#bayesian-optimisation){:.mdLink}**, **[Natural Language Processing](/machine-learning-glossary/#natural-language-processing){:.mdLink}**, **[Recurrrent Neural Networks](/machine-learning-glossary/#recurrent-neural-network){:.mdLink}** and **[Model-based Reinforcement Learning](/machine-learning-glossary/#model-based-reinforcement-learning){:.mdLink}**.
