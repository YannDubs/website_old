The list and reviews are still under construction :sleepy: It is at the top of my to do list though: be sure to check it often!

Also you should probably have a look at the [Machine Learning Glossary](/machine-learning-glossary/){:.mdLink}

There are so many useful machine learning resources out there and even more log posts reviewing these resources :sweat_smile:. The goal of this page is not to list everything but only those that I have used/(partially) completed/read and that I can review. Maybe it will be hopeful for someone but I also want to keep track of what I have seen and liked. 

:mag: <span class='note'> Side Notes </span> :
* I have a strong preference towards videos, interactive visualization, and intuitive mathematical explanation (i.e I don't need proofs but I need a mathematical intuition).
* Click on the resources to get some additional information!
* If they aren't self-explanatory, here is the meaning of the emojis I'm using: :books: books /:movie_camera: Course videos or MOOCS / :computer: blogs / :headphones: podcasts
