# YannDubs.github.io

Personal website used as a portfolio and a general machine learning blog. 

I started writing this blog for a selfish purpose: I have a bad memory and want to have a "simple and clear" (completely subjective) [Machine Learning Glossary](https://yanndubs.github.io/ML-Glossary/) of things I learn. I then thought of publishing it as thinking that other people could be reading it (although highly unprobable) makes me think twice about what and how I write. Although I started it in a selfish purpose I really hope that it could also helpful to someone else and that I can also contribute (even slightly) to the ML revolution.

Nota Bene: 
* It's the first time I write something online, I would love to get some feedbacks <3
* I'm using (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/home/] with GitHub pages to make the site. The theme used is (clean blog)[https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/]. All credits go to them :).
