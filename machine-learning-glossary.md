  <summary><b>What</b></summary>
  
  <p>I will try to summarise important/interesting terms and concepts of machine learning. The focus is on intuition but there will also be practical and theoretical notes. </p>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why</b></summary>
  
  <p>Having a bad memory but beeing (at least considering myself to be :sweat_smile: ) a philomath who loves machine learning, I developped the habit of taking notes, then summarizing and finally making a cheat sheet for every new ML domain I encounter. There are multiple reasons I want to switch to a webpage: </p>
 
  <ul>
    <li><p>Having lots of paper is <b>not practical</b> and prone to loss.  </p></li>
    <li><p>The idea that someone I don't know (I'm talking about you :raising_hand: ) might read this post at some point <b>makes me want to write higher quality notes</b> .</p></li>
    <li><p>I have always been impressed by how much people are willing to spend time on forums and open source projects. I'm forever gratefull to them and <b>I now want to give back to the community</b> (The contribution isn't comparable, but I have to start somewhere :innocent: ).</p></li>
    <li><p>Taking notes on a computer is a necessary step for my migragtion from Biomedical Engineering to CS. I guess you could call that <b>peer pressure</b> :sweat_smile: .</p></li>
    <li><p> As wise man once said: <blockquote> You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. <cite> - Albert Einstein </cite>
    	   </blockquote> 
    	   My grandma's are awesome :heart: but not really into ML (yet). You have thus been designated "volunteer" to temporarily replace them.
    </p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>To make it easier to search the relevant information in the Glossary here is the color coding I will be using:  </p>
 
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :bulb: <span class="intuition"> Intuition </span> </li>
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :wrench: <span class="practice"> Practical </span> </li>
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :red_circle: <span class="disadvantage"> Disadvantage </span> </li>
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :white_check_mark: <span class="advantage"> Advantage </span> </li>
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :school_satchel: <span class="example"> Example </span> </li>
    <li class="col-xs-6"> :mag: <span class="note"> Side notes </span> </li>
    <li style="position:relative;left:15px;"> :information_source: <span class="ressource"> Ressources </span><br /> </li>
  </ul>

**Disclaimer**: 

* This is my **first post ever** :bowtie:, I would love to get your feedback.
* I'm bad at spelling. I **apologize in advance for any mistakes** (feel free to correct me).    
* **Check out the [ressources](/ressources/){:.mdLink}** from where I got most of this information. 

Enough talking: let's get going ! I suggest to use `Ctrl+f` as there are quite a few terms.

*Nota Bene: these terms are not always the most important ones but important ones I have encountered since my "migration" to machine learning / computer science in September 2016.*

Thanks to [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/){:.mdLink}, my Machine Learning professor, who introduced me to this amazing field.
