**Disclaimer**: 

* This is my **first post ever** :bowtie:, I would love to get your feedback.
* I'm bad at spelling. I **apologize in advance for any mistakes** (feel free to correct me).    
* **Check out the [ressources](/ressources/){:.mdLink}** page which contains videos/books/etc. from where I got most of this information. Thanks to [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/){:.mdLink}, my Machine Learning professor, who also taught me a lot and introduced me to this amazing field.

# Introduction 

<details>
  <summary><b>What</b></summary>
  <p>
  
  Here, I will try to summarise important terms from machine learning. The foucs in on intuition but there will be practical as well as **theoreticall** notes. 
  
  </p></details> 

<details>
  <summary><b>Why</b></summary>
  <p>
  
  Having a bad memory but beeing (at least considering myself to be :sweat_smile: ) a philomath who loves machine learning, I the habit of taking notes, then summarizing and finally making a cheat sheet for every new ML domain I encounter. There are multiple reasons I want to switch to a webpage:
 
  <ol>
    <li>Having lots **of** paper is <b>not practical</b> and prone to loss. </li>
    <li>The idea that someone I don't know (I'm talking about you :raising_hand: ) might read this post at some point <b>makes me want to write higher quality notes</b> .</li>
    <li>I have always been impressed by how much people are willing to spend time on forums and open source projects. I'm forever gratefull to them and <b>I now want to give back to the community</b> (The contribution isn't comparable, but I have to start somewhere :innocent: ).</li>
    <li>Taking notes on a computer is a necessary step for my migragtion from Biomedical Engineering to CS. I guess you could call that <b>peer pressure</b> :sweat_smile: .</li>
    <li> As wise man once said: <blockquote> You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. <cite> - Albert Einstein </cite>
    	   </blockquote> 
    	   My grandma's are awesome :heart: but not really into ML (yet). You have thus been designated "volunteer" to temporarily replace them.
    </li>
  </ol>

**How:** 

* To make it easier to search the relevant information in the Glossary here are the color codes I will be using: 

* <p class = "intuition"> Intuition </p>hshs

*Nota Bene: these terms are not always the most important ones but important ones I have encountered since my "migration" to machine learning / computer science in September 2016.*
