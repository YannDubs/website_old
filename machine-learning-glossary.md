**Disclaimer**: 

* This is my **first post ever** :bowtie:, I would love to get feedback from someone (if anyone ever reads this post).
* I have always been very bad at spelling. I **apologize in advance for any mistakes** (feel free to correct me).
* **Please check out the [Ressources]({{ site.baseurl }})** page for a list of excellent ressources from where I got mot of this information. A big thanks to [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/), my professor for 2 Machine Learning classes at UBC, who taught me a lot and who made me want to pursue a career in that domain.

# Introduction 

**What:** In this page, I will try to summarise the clearest way I can important terms from machine learning and other closely related fields. 

**Why:** Having a bad memory but beeing (at least considering myself to be :sweat_smile: ) a philomath who loves machine learning, I developped the habit of taking hand-written notes (crazy nowadays right ?), then summarizing and finally making a cheat sheet for every new ML domain I encounter. There are multiple reasons I want to switch to a webpage:

1. Having lots of paper is **not practical** and prone to loss. 
2. The idea that someone I don't know (I'm talking about you :raising_hand: ) might read this post at some point **makes me want to write higher quality notes**.
2. During university as I was explaining concepts to friends or beeing TA in a few classes, I realized not only how nice it is to feel helpful but also how **explaning something to someone makes you better understand the subject**.
3. I have always been so impressed by how much people are willing to work on open source projects and answer questions on forums. I wouldn't really understand the majority of the concepts below if it wasn't for them. **I now want to give back to the community** (even if the contribution is neglectable, I have to start somewhere :innocent: ).
4. I feel that taking notes on a computer is a necessary step now for my migragtion from Biomedical Engineering to Computer Science. I guess you could call that **peer pressure** :sweat_smile: .

**How:** 

*Nota Bene: these terms are not always the most important ones but important ones I have encountered since my "migration" to machine learning / computer science in September 2016. *
